Code used in experiment investigating effect of nucleus reuniens stimulation on spatial working memory. 
rePower_test: determine theta stimulation frequency for task
testingDA_10_9_laserstim_allCondi_rm153: maze code for testing rodents on delayed alternation task in a T-maze with varying optogenetic stimulation conditions. 
  3 testing day types based on maze location: maze start box (during delay period), maze stem entry to choice point exit, maze goal box to start box entry
  2 laser conditions: red, blue (laser will turn on/off based on IR beam breaks or live tracking data) 
  2 delay conditions: short and long
